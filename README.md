# 18xplore

## Components
- A deck of public and private (side-bet) adventuring guilds.
  - Public companies (guilds) are opened at a given price and have a special ability.
  - Private companies (side bets) are opened at any price, and pay out a multiplier.
    - Example: when a 6-expedition retires, gain 2x your bet.
- Eight colors of “potentials” (wooden disks).
  - 15mm x 6mm wooden disks, and two 15mm x 10mm wooden cylinders.
  - These are used as shares and as offices (marking control of a source).
- A bag of 5/8" expedition tokens, numbered and double-sided.
  - One side is the active side, the other is "just about to retire", with +1 value.
  - The active side also has the cost, which is 10x (value+1).
  - There are more 2s than 3s, more 3s than 4s, up to about 8ish.
  - 66 tokens is more than enough, but that's a P&P sheet.
  - Alternatively, baby meeples or cubes would work for this.
- Sets of 22 (2.6") hexagon map tiles.
  - Each tile has connections on all six sides.
  - Each connection leads through a node to another side, or ends at a source
    or a sink node.
  - Source nodes are cities, potential office locations, with a cost of 20ish.
  - Intermediate nodes are villages, with values from 1 to 5.
  - Sink nodes are ruins, with values from 6 to 10.
  - Paths never branch.
  - One hex (the start) is a large city with six sources.
  - One hex has a valuable sink that all six hit.
  - Otherwise, at most 32 paths can hit a sink, and at most 32 sources start a path.
- Poker chips for the bank.

## Setup
1. Put the starting hex (capital city with six sources) in the middle of the table.
2. Draw six expeditions out of the bag to make the expedition market.
3. Shuffle the deck of guilds and flip six over to make the guild market.
4. Give each player $400.

## Investment Rounds
Players take turns selling as many potentials as they want (placing them back
into the bank for someone else to purchase) and then choosing one action:

- Start a new guild: take the card and a color of free potentials, set its
  initial price and pay twice that to buy the leader disk (larger-than-normal
  potential), and place a potential at an available starting location.
- Buy a private guild: take the card and pay your bet amount onto it. When it
  triggers, it pays out as a multiplier of your bet. (These are things like:
  "when a 6-expedition retires, pay 2x your bet".)
- Buy an available guild share: take the potential, pay the price to that
  guild’s card. That guild’s leader may choose to make another one available,
  if they like.

*Buybacks:* A guild can buy back potentials in the Expedition Round by paying
their current price.

## Expedition Rounds
Guilds take turns exploring, expanding, and expedition-ing, from highest price to lowest.

1. Explore by paying for hex tiles. The first is 10, the second 20, the third
   30, and so on. Pay for everything from the company coffers and draw them all
   before placing any. Tiles must be placed so they connect to one of your
   potential paths, and don’t lead any paths back to a starting position. If
   they can’t be placed, they’re discarded.

2. Build at most one new outpost. Place it on any available starting location,
   which lists the outpost cost ($40ish).

3. Send out expeditions and pay dividends. For each outpost with an expedition
   token, trace its path ’til you’ve hit as many treasures as the token’s
   value. The sum of those treasures is paid to each potential (players get $
   for each, and the guild gets $ for each sitting on the card). The sum of the
   treasures also affects the guild’s price: if less than half the price, it
   drops. If more than the price, it goes up, 1846-style.

4. Buy new expedition tokens from the market (at 10x their value+1). When
   bought, immediately place them on an outpost. If an outpost already has a
   token, you may not replace it. After buying all you want / can, replace from
   the bag.

The game consists of cycles of: one investment round, then two expedition
rounds, then retirement, then repeat until the bank breaks.

## Retirement
After the second expedition, just before the next investment round is *retirement.*

Look at all the expedition counters and find the lowest group-by-value sum (?).
(For 2, 3, 6, 10, that’s the 2. For 2, 2, 2, 5, the 2s sum together and the 5
is the lowest.) Flip all counters in that group to their "just about to retire
side." They’ll get one last expedition and then be thrown back into the bag.

## End
When the bank breaks, the game ends at the next retirement. Whoever has the
most money (including the value of their potentials) wins!
