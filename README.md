# 184x

## Components
- A deck of public and private (side-bet) adventuring guilds.
- Six to eight colors of “potentials” (wooden disks).
- A bag of expedition tokens, numbered 2 to ?, with more at the bottom.
- A bunch of hexagon map tiles, with paths in from each side and nodes with value / cost.
- Poker chips.

## Investment Rounds
Players take turns selling as many potentials as they want (placing them back onto the owning guild's card, flipped over to show that they won’t pay dividends) and then choosing one action:

- Start a new guild: take the card and a color of free potentials, set its
	initial price and pay twice that to buy the leader disk (larger-than-normal
	potential), and place a potential at an available starting location.
- Buy a private guild: take the card and pay your bet amount onto it. When it
	triggers, it pays out as a multiplier of your bet. (These are things like:
	“when a 6-expedition retires, pay 2x your bet”.)
- Buy an available guild share: take the potential, pay the price to that
	guild’s card. That guild’s leader may choose to make another one available,
	if they like.

*Buybacks:* A guild can unflip potentials in the Expedition Round by paying their current price.

## Expedition Rounds
Guilds take turns exploring, expanding, and expedition-ing, from highest price to lowest.

1. Explore by paying for hex tiles. The first is 10, the second 20, the third
	 30, and so on. Pay for everything from the company coffers and draw them all
	 before placing any. Tiles must be placed so they connect to one of your
	 potential paths, and don’t lead any paths back to a starting position. If
	 they can’t be placed, they’re discarded.

2. Build at most one new outpost. Place it on any available starting location,
	 which lists the outpost cost.

3. Send out expeditions and pay dividends. For each outpost with an expedition
	 token, trace its path ’til you’ve hit as many treasures as the token’s
	 value. The sum of those treasures is paid to each potential (players get $
	 for each, and the guild gets $ for each sitting on the card). The sum of the
	 treasures also affects the guild’s price: if less than half the price, it
	 drops. If more than the price, it goes up, 1846-style.

4. Buy new expedition tokens from the market (at 10x their value+1). When
	 bought, immediately place them on an outpost. If an outpost already has a
	 token, you may not replace it. After buying all you want / can, replace from
	 the bag.

Game is one investment, then two expedition, then back to investment.

## Retirement
After the second expedition, just before the next investment round is *retirement.*

Look at all the expedition counters and find the lowest group-by-value sum.
(For 2, 3, 6, 10, that’s the 2. For 2, 2, 2, 5, the 2s sum together and the 5
is the lowest.) Flip all counters in that group to their "just about to retire
side." They’ll get one last expedition and then be thrown back into the bag.

## End
When the bank breaks, the game ends at the next retirement. Whoever has the
most money (including the value of their potentials) wins!
